	<p>Welcome to my portfolio site! I hope that all my visitors can not only get a sense of the techniques behind my work, but also what I aim to accomplish with every project.</p>
	<p>My personal philosophy on games is that they are the most powerful storytelling medium of today's society, and as a designer, I have a duty to use all the facets that only this medium provides to tell stories that are representative of not only different cultures, but also the different values and philosophies that are behind them. I want to create projects that are not only fluid and satisfying to experience, but ones that can expand upon the way that people play games or see the world around them through the mechanics and narratives I present. My work aims to create the same types of experiences that made me fall in love with games as a young kid so many years ago, alongside the other kids whose hearts race over online battles, who cry when they lose a character close to them, and who stare in awe when they look down from the mountaintop they worked so hard to climb. I want to make games that can bring those kids out of tired bodies and sad faces, and games that are powerful enough to bring people, who may look different but laugh the same together over a shared passion.</p>

	<h2 id="about" style="text-align: unset;">About</h2>
	<p>Born in Alabama and raised in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, Daniel fell in love with video games from a young age. While he also spent time from a young age art and music classes both in school and after school, Daniel was also very curious about everything in the world around him, and the same sense of adventure that made him fall in love with adventure games from a young age translated into his desire to join the Boy Scouts, and he would eventually earn his Eagle Scout during his senior year of high school. He wanted a way to combine his love for playing games and his skill for creating art and enrolled in the Integrated Digital Media program at New York University to learn not only game development but to further evolve his stance on art and how it can be integrated into the technology around us.</p>
	<p>	Daniel’s excellence in his advanced placement classes during his high school years put him on a fast track to graduate from college in just three years as opposed to the typical four, and he chose to attend NYU so that he could meet and learn from a more diverse student population than he could have if he had stayed in the south. During his first year, he joined the Violet Leadership Institute at NYU to develop his leadership style, which is based on inclusion and support of all members. Later on, during his third year, he would use this style to site lead an Alternative Breaks trip in public health to his home city of Atlanta, where he saw the intersectionality between the healthcare system and his own perspective, and to learn the difficulties that his fellow students face in their own studies and experience in New York.</p>
