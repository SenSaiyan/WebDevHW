The goals I set out for the final in order of priority:
1. Smooth Scrolling for Header
2. Responsive Header that changes to expandable menu when in mobile
3. Slideshow for Photo and Art sections
4. Game Demo for Current Project

I succeeded in the first two and have issues with the third goal (first slide is empty due to JS code not reading style property), but could not export my current project to HTML5 format because the IDE I'm using does not include a license to export in that format.

Originally I wanted to include carousel indicators for the slideshow but managing two separate scripts for two different slideshows cluttered the code, causing bugs to were related to the two slideshows overlapping. I was [reading online](https://conversionxl.com/blog/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels/) and discovered that people in industry don't really like to use them, so I decided to pull the feature.

I wanted to also include quality of life changes to the website's overall appearance, including making some symbols unselectable.

I had a very basic knowledge of JS going into this project, and none regarding how it interacts with a webpage, but I learned the basic logic of backend through this process. It seems very suboptimal at first glance (getting all the elements by class name, putting it into a different object, then running code on that object). However, I now see how the interactions between frontend and backend make this roundabout-seeming methodology a necessity.

If I had more tools and more money, I would want to purchase the license to allow me to export a game demo in HTML5 format and put it on the site, or make a different game from scratch in JS other than the bouncing balls from a previous assignment.
