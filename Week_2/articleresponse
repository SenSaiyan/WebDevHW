In my other IDM courses, a big thing that the instructors and workflow lessons spent a lot of time on was focus, not only on staying on taskk, but also keeping in mind who or what you are designing for. While short, this article is a way to bring that kind of focus to people who have just started out in web development and put into words what I should be expecting of myself as I learn in this course. Many of the points in the article overlap with my prior knowledge, which I think works in my favor because I can apply the strengths I have built over my college years to something that I'm not too familiar with.
